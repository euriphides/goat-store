install intellij into kubuntu virtual machine
install mongo
install mongo server

list of objectives:

write a vue application that does crud (create read update delete)
node will do crud over an http api
persistence mechanism will be mongo
build unit tests for some of the node code
use postman to test our api

next:
start using express - it has a lot of node http shenanigans that we don't want to handle - it will handle it for use
learn to read and write express middleware

create a mongo database, and have the process running 
learn how to work with mongoose - an npm package to work with mongo
